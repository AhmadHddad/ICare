## **ICare - patient registration system** .

This app is made with ReactJs, NetCore 3.1, currently, I am using SQLite DB for easier development.

**Description:**
Free open-source patient registration system, so hospitals and doctors can share patients medical history therefore making it easier on doctors to diagnose patients.
I hope to get some help from contributors :D, so developed countries that can't afford such system can benefit from this system, or at least build on it.
